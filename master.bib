  abstract = {Target position estimation in radar and sonar means joint estimation of range and angle in the presence of noise and clutter. The global behavior of a maximum likelihood (ML) position estimator, and the clutter suppression capability of the system, can be written in terms of a range-angle ambiguity function. This function depends upon signal waveform and array configuration, i.e., upon both temporal and spatial characteristics of the system. Ambiguity and variance bound analysis indicates that system bandwidth can often be traded for array size, and direction-dependent signals can be used to obtain better angle resolution without increasing the size of the array. Wide-band direction-dependent signals (temporal diversity) can be traded for large real or synthetic arrays (spatial diversity). This tradeoff is apparently exploited by some animal echolocation systems. The above insights are obtained mostly from the properties of the range-angle ambiguity function. In general, an appropriate ambiguity function should be very useful for the design and evaluation of any ML parameter estimator. System identification methods and radio navigation systems, for example, can be optimized by minimizing the volume of a multiparameter ambiguity function.},

The naval problem that motivates time delay estimation is the source state estimation problem. A discussion of this problem in terms of estimating the position and velocity of a moving acoustic source is presented. Optimum bearing and range estimators are presented for the planar problem and related to the optimum time delay vector estimator. Suboptimum realizations are considered together with the effects of source motion and receiver positional uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly being used by military forces to acquire high-resolution sonar imagery, in order to detect mines and other objects of interest on the seabed. Automatic detection and classification teclmiques are being developed for several reasons: to provide reliable and consistent detection of objects on the seabed; to free human analysts from time-consuming and tedious detection tasks; and to enable autonomous in-field decision-making based on observations of mines and other objects. This document reviews progress in the development of automated detection and classification teclmiques for side-looking sonars mounted on AUVs. Whilst the teclmiques have not yet reached maturity, considerable progress has been made in both unsupervised and supervised (trained) algoritluns for feature detection and classification. In some cases, the perfonnance and reliability of automated detection systems exceed those of human operators.},

  abstract = {This work addresses the problem of semantic scene understanding under foggy road conditions. Although marked progress has been made in semantic scene understanding over the recent years, it is mainly concentrated on clear weather outdoor scenes. Extending semantic segmentation methods to adverse weather conditions like fog is crucially important for outdoor applications such as self-driving cars. In this paper, we propose a novel method, which uses purely synthetic data to improve the performance on unseen real-world foggy scenes captured in the streets of Zurich and its surroundings. Our results highlight the potential and power of photo-realistic synthetic images for training and especially fine-tuning deep neural nets. Our contributions are threefold, 1) we created a purely synthetic, high-quality foggy dataset of 25,000 unique outdoor scenes, that we call Foggy Synscapes and plan to release publicly 2) we show that with this data we outperform previous approaches on real-world foggy test data 3) we show that a combination of our data and previously used data can even further improve the performance on real-world foggy data.},

Results are presented which demonstrate the ability of the network to classify biological, man made, and geological sources. Also included are capabilities of the networks to attack the more difficult problems of identifying the complex vocalizations of several fish and marine mammalian species. Basic structure, processor requirements, training and operational methodologies are described as well as application to autonomous observation and vehicle platforms.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has rapidly transformed the state of the art algorithms used to address a variety of problems in computer vision and robotics. These breakthroughs have relied upon massive amounts of human annotated training data. This time consuming process has begun impeding the progress of these deep learning efforts. This paper describes a method to incorporate photo-realistic computer images from a simulation engine to rapidly generate annotated data that can be used for the training of machine learning algorithms. We demonstrate that a state of the art architecture, which is trained only using these synthetic annotations, performs better than the identical architecture trained on human annotated real-world data, when tested on the KITTI data set for vehicle detection. By training machine learning algorithms on a rich virtual world, real objects in real scenes can be learned and classified using synthetic data. This approach offers the possibility of accelerating deep learning's application to sensor-based classification problems like those that appear in self-driving cars. The source code and data to train and validate the networks described in this paper are made available for researchers.},

Hence, in the ocean as opposed to air or a vacuum, one uses sound navigation and ranging (SONAR) instead of radar, acoustic communication instead of radio, and acoustic imaging and tomography instead of microwave or optical imaging or X-ray tomography. Underwater acoustics is the science of sound in water (most commonly in the ocean) and encompasses not only the study of sound propagation, but also the masking of sound signals by interfering phenomenon and signal processing for extracting these signals from interference. This chapter we will present the basics physics of ocean acoustics and then discuss applications.},
